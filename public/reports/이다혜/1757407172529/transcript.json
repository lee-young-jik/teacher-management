  "text": "Okay. No, nothing. Okay, so can you please complete this question? How many cookies did they eat? Did they eat? They ate eight cookies. Of course. How many or how many or how much of the cookies did they eat? Did they. Did each of them eat? Right. Okay, so let's write that down. How much of the cookie. Oops. Did they eat? Okay. Did. Is it. Did they eat? If you see. Did they eat. Of course. It's just eight cookies, isn't it? Each of them eat. E. Yes. Okay. Did Michael write this down or do you have your own question? No, I just did it. I wrote it down. I haven't seen you writing it down. Did you. What? I thought. Okay. Okay, my bad. Okay, so this is a story. Right. So what is the equation for this? We're not going to write the equation, but can you please tell me the equation? Eight divided by three. Okay. It's just eight divided by three. Right. Which is equal to eight thirds, right? Huh? This question is showing you dividing into thirds. Do you get it? Yeah. This time we're not dividing in two thirds. We're dividing it by one third. One third. This is tricky. How are we gonna make the story? Can Michael give an example then this time. Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael had. Michael has ten pizzas. He shares them with two friends and himself. Wait, isn't that divided by three, which is. No. Okay. Can you then continue? So I don't know how to, like, do that. Okay. I think it's. There are three pizzas. Okay. Each people ate one third of it. That's good. One. Okay. Each person ate one third of it. Then what should be the question then? Can Abby complete this question? Let's see. Okay, so let's write that down. So who has. I mean, Michael has. Michael has. How many pizzas? How many pizzas? What did. What did you say, Michael? Ten pizzas. Yes, ten pizzas. And that. He divides it by one third. No, no, wait. That wasn't the question. Can you please repeat that, Michael? So Michael baked. Okay. And pizzas. He shares them. Wait. With two people. No, wait, that wasn't the one. Wait, I know. I. People. Three people eat one third of it. I need a racer. Wait, I'm going to get a racer. Not three people. Abby, I'm waiting for you. Okay. Come here. Okay. You should close the door. Michael's room. Oh, right. Or else you'll hear the echo forever. Thank you. Okay, you can now unmute yourself. Michael, can you unmute? Okay. Michael, I cannot hear you. You have to unmute. I did. No, you didn't. Okay. So Michael baked 10 pizzas. Yeah. How are we gonna divide them by one third? Not three? Yeah, Michael baked. I mean, Michael baked ten pizzas. He sliced them into eight equal parts. No, no, three people ate one third of it. Wait, okay, three people. Three. Yeah. Where did you get that? Three people? I mean. That should actually be the question, isn't it? Like, for example, you have 10. She ate, see, one third of it. Like, each person ate. Each person ate one third of it. But we need to know how many people. That's the question. Actually. Each person ate one third of person and one third of the. One third of the pizza. Yes. So what will be the question? How many slices of pizza are left? Really are. How many pizzas are there? Pizzas? There are 10 pizzas. Pizza slices. Pizza slices, yeah. We don't know, like, how they cut this pizza. Right. We only know that each person ate one third and there are 10 pizzas. The question should be how many. People. People are there? Are there? Or more or like, how many people could eat the pizza? Right. Let's see. How many people are there? Or how many people could eat the pizza? Joe, what is the equation for this question? What is the equation? What is this? 10 divided by 1 third. Okay, it's 10 divided by 1 third, which is. If it's divided by 1 third. How do we change this? 10? It's 10 over 3. 10 over 3. No, that's 10 divided by 3. 10 times 1 third. Good. Oh, 10 times 1 third. Are you just gonna Change the sign? 10 times 3. Good job. It's 10 times 3. Right. You should switch, like, 30. 30. 30 people were there. Gosh. 30 people could eat the pizza. Right? Okay, so any questions in this part? Let's see. Do you get this now? Yeah. What about Michael, do you understand this? Let's see, what else I have trouble with. Which number? Oh, this one. Number210. Oh, page 210. Yeah. Number. What? What? The bottom one. The bottom one. Number five. Yeah, it's so. So. The, like, the way it's, like, shown, it's complicated. Okay, so let's. Can Michael please read this? Oh, my gosh. He doesn't know where we are. 210. Yeah. Paul uses 1/5 liter of chicken. Oh, Michael, Michael, Michael. At the bottom la. A quilt is made from. From squares, rectangles and right triangles. One third of the pieces are each shape. Sir, Divides the square pieces into four equal groups and make one group from red fabric. What fraction of quilt pieces will be red squares? Do you understand this question? A little bit A little bit. Okay, so let's go through the questions together. So a kilt is made from squares, rectangles, and right triangles. Right. Okay. So one third of the pieces are each pink. So one third of this kilt is square, one third is rectangles, and one third is made out of right triangles. That's how this model looks like. Do you get it? Yeah. Then, sir divides the square pieces into four equal groups. Oh. Square pieces into four equal groups and make one group from red fabric. Do you get it? Yeah. Okay, so complete this visual model. We're not. We don't know rectangles and right triangles. We don't have any information about that. But then we know about the squares, right? Yeah. So how are you going to complete this visual model? So I did it. Okay. How did you do this? Let me see. Oh, I can't see. I can't see. Okay, but I'll tell you. Okay. Abby drew this. Abby did this. Okay. Why do you think Abby splitted this into four equal parts? Because. Because. Because it says here, sir divides the square pieces into four equal groups, right? Yeah. So the top one is the square pieces, Right? This is square pieces. And he divides them into four equal groups. Like what Abby did. Yeah. Right. And then one. One red. One is okay. And one is red. So you should shade one. Actually, I'll shade in red. You don't have to feed in red. You can just shade with your pencil. Okay, so that's the red fabric. Do you get it? Yeah. Okay. Then the question is what fraction of the kilt pieces will be red squares? So what fraction is this? What fraction is this of the whole kilt? So. Oh, who's that? Abigail. Okay. Okay, so explain how to use equivalent fractions and logical reasoning to solve the problem. Okay, let's first use an equation. Guys, what fraction of the squares? Like what fraction of the whole kilt are squares. Four? No, I. I will ask you again. So what fraction of the whole kilt is a square? This square is what fraction of the whole one? Four. One. One third. One third. Michael, is it one third? Yeah. Okay, it's one third. Right. And 1/4. Right. One groups out of four equal groups, which means it's 1/4, right? Oh. One fourth of that squares is red. Do you get it? Yeah. Oh. So 1/4 of the squares, which means it's 1. What is the equation? How do we get 1/4 of 1/3? Who knows how to do this? Not me. Not me. Did you say not me? Ah. 14 times 1 third. 1 fourth, 1 fourth times 1 third. Thank you, Michael. Were you listening? Yes. 14 times 1 third. Okay, so 1 fourth times 1 third. So that is. It's 1 12, 1 12th. Good job. So we can use fractions and equations to get right the answer. So the. The answer is 1:12 of the killed pieces. Okay, that is the answer. But is there other ways we can solve this without using the equation like this? I guess so. Oh. Not really. Not real pressure. Okay, actually, why don't we divide them like this? And we know that this red part is actually one of the 12 equal pieces. Right. Talking about Mike, huh? Okay, so let's say that we had four equal groups on our squares, right? What if we have this thing, we split it everything into fours. Then how many equal groups will you see? Four times three, which is 12. We can see 12 equals groups, right? Yeah. Of them, that's one over 12. Do you get it? Yeah, we have the same answer. Yeah. Got one over 12 a while ago. And this is still one of our 12th, right? Do you get it? Yeah. Yes. Are you sure? Why are you laughing? Let me join. What? Let me join. Why are you guys laughing? Okay. Do you have any. Do you have other questions? Let's see. Yeah, I got. Actually, no. Actually, yes, I got one at 210. Like. Then again, the first Paul. The thing Paul uses. I got that one. I can explain it. Okay, show me that. No. How? Uses 1/5 letter of chicken boof and 1/2 packet of noodles for a bowl of soup. How many bowls of soup can he make for 4 liters of chicken boof? Okay, so what numerical information is need to solve the problem? I did 1/5 litter of chicken boo Because. Because the packet of noodles maybe for the soup, but you need chicken broth. So it's easier if we do chicken broth for four little of the chicken broth. Okay, which number should you divide through this problem? Four and one. How? Four, four divided by one fifth. What? Okay, yeah. Because it says he uses one fifth liter of chicken broth for each bowl, right? Yeah. How do we get the number of bowls? Of course. 4 liters divided by 1/5 liters. Right? Very good. So the equation. So the equation should be. What is. What was the equation, Abby? Four divided by one fifth. Great job. That is equal to 20. 24. Wait, did you write 20 right away? It has to be four times five, which is 20. 20. Did you just write 20? No, I wrote. I wrote the equation. No, still 20. Did you just write 20 like this with anything? What is missing? Unit units. 20 what? 20 bowls of soup. Oh, very good. So, wait, I wrote in the wrong place, which. It says, which numbers should you divide to solve the problems? Right. So you first have to write four divided by 1 1/5. Right. How did you do that? And it says, write and solve an equation. Then that's the time you do this. Right. Ta da. So cool. Wait, what? What's happening? I don't know what you're doing. Okay. I can't see what you're even doing. Don't see my screen? Yeah. Really? Yeah. You see this now? No, I'll go check on this. But you have to mute. What? I didn't. Yeah, now I can't. Abby, can you see Michael? Michael, now you cannot see the screen. Okay, I'm gonna mute. Matabi. You can't see the screen. Yeah, but I can't see her. But she's right. Michael can't see what can you. Can. Can you unmute now? Like, close. Close the door. Guys, close the door. Ms. Jasmine, Michael can only see your face, not the whiteboard. Okay, I know what's happening. Can you please swipe the screen? Michael, can you try. Yeah, I do both ways still. Both ways. Did you try both ways? I can't see her screen. You moved the pin. Okay, can you share it? Can you share it? Oh, I'm sharing. Wait, let me re. Share it. Bye. Bye. See? Oh, nice. Okay, there you go. Now I have to find my pencil. Thanks, Appa. Where's my pencil? Oh, here. So, actually, you guys know that 1 4th. I mean, 4 divided by 1 5th is 20, right? How did you know it's 20 without using multiplication? Actually, there's one way. Yeah, 4 times 5. I mean, like, without using multiplication. How can you explain this? 4 divided by 1/5? What does that even mean? 4 divided by 1 fifth? Oopsies. Michael's so busy doing. Look, the camera's following Michael. Okay? Oh, four divided by one fifth means how many one fifths are in four, right? Do you get it? Yeah. So how many one fifths are in four? How can you answer to that question? Okay, I'm gonna change the question. How many one fifths are there in one two. How many? Of course five, right? Then how many one fifths are there in two? Plenty. 10. 10. You get it. So how many one one fist and po. 20. So this is 20, right? After you answer all our questions. What are. What are we like. What are we. What are we gonna do, like Common Core or. We'll do Common Core. And I also prepared some other questions. Fractions and decimals. Wait, Fractions and decimals like this, but that. Not that one. Don't have them. You just need, like, extra paper or notebook. But I'm not sure we will do that today because we will do the common cord too. Okay. Okay, so explain how to use multiplication to check your answer. So four divided by one fifth can. Be written as four times one fifth. What? Four times one fifth? Are you sure? Four times four times five. So which is 20. So your answer's correct? Yeah. Understood. Can I ask a question? Why am I not on the screen? Like, yeah, you're not on the screen, but you're on my screen. So don't worry. I can see you, like, on the. Front or on the bottom corners? On the side. All on the bottom, Michael. But some. But I see now I see you in the center, like, what? At the big. Okay, guys, do you have any other questions in this? No. Then it's time for us to move on to the common core. So did you finish week 11? Guys, I have day four to do. I think week 11. I'm not sure. Well, I. I got. I got maybe about three more questions today. Oh, wait, week 11. I. Oh, yeah, I just got four more questions to do. Like, day What? I didn't have time to do it because I was also doing week 12. Oh, sure. So let's try week 11. Wait, no, we're not doing week 11 now. We're not doing week 11. They're your homework, guys. Okay. Do we have double homework? No, not double homework, but do we. Then why do we have to do week 12 as homework? Let's make it a double homework because we're not meeting on Saturday this week, right? Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, are you excited? So Please finish week 11 and 12 on both part one and two. Do you get it? Got it. Okay. Okay, then. Now, do you have any notebooks or trap paper? Notebook? Yeah, I'll get it. Grab one, Michael. You too. Can you grab one? No. Like this? Any. Oh, yeah, that one. Yes, thank you. That one. Good job. So I'm gonna show you some questions. Do you see them? Well, no. Yeah, I see them. Well, I don't see them all. You don't see them all? What do you mean? Yeah, like, I don't really see. Even if it's small. Like this. Oh, now I see. Okay, so can. Can Abby please read number one? We will do number one together. And I'm gonna make you do number two by yourself. Okay. Okay, so let's read them all. Number two. He has two big pumpkin fields and the total area of two pumpkin fields is three and 2 5th acres. The big field yield 32 5th tons of pumpkins. And the small, 2, 112 tons of pumpkins. What is the total yield of pumpkins? So do you have any idea for this what should be the equation? 3, 25 plus 2 times 21 12. Okay, what about you, Michael, what do you think? 3, 25. Times. 2112 plus 3, 2 5. Okay, Michael, can you please read the question again? Yes. Two pumpkin fields and two total areas of two pumpkin fields and three, two, five across acres. Acres. The big field yield. The big fueled yield. Three two fifth tons of pumpkins and small to one tons of pumpkins. What is the total yield of pumpkins? You actually have to read fractions like three and two fifths. Oh, so it's three two fifth plus three two five times to one twelve. What is the question? Abby? What is the question asking you? What is the total? Oh, yeah, so I was correct. 3 2/5 times. What? What again? Times 2, 1 12. Why are you multiplying them? Wait, what is the total yield of pumpkins? Right? Are we even interested in the acres? Like how, how wide the area is? The filters, do we want to know that? No. No. Do we even need the first number, three and two fifths then? Guys, do we. Are we using all these three numbers? Yeah. Yes. Why? Can you please explain? The question is what is the total yield of pumpkins? Right, so we, we want. Oh, we. We don't need all of these three numbers. What do we need then? We need. We need. Are you looking at this, guys? So look at this. The big field yields three and two fifths tons, right? Yeah. And the small field yields two and 112 of tons of pumpkins. Right? The total yield of pumpkins, 2, 112. Plus 3, 2, 5. Yes. We should add these two. Right? So what, what do we have to do with this number? Do we have to know the area of the field? No. No. Then cross this out. We don't need them. Right? We don't need them for now, but maybe we can use this later on. So let's just keep it. But we're not using this now. So what is the equation, Michael? Again, it's 3 2/5. 3 and 2/5. 3 and 2 fifth plus 3 and 2 fifth time. Oh my God. The answer is 55 over 2, 2960. Okay, let's look at this together. So the big field yields 3 1/2/5 tons of pumpkins, right? The small field, small field yields 2, 112 tons of pumpkins, right? Total yield. What is the total yield? Michael? The total yield is 5 and. Oh, like. Can you tell me the equation? It's Ow. Three. And multiply them. Subtract them or what? What are you going to do with these numbers? Add. Add. You will add them, right? Because you're getting the total of these two, right? Are you multiplying something? No. No. So you should add them. It's three and two fifths plus two and one twelve. Okay, Abby, you got the answer. How did you solve this? With this. Oh, can you please explain using words? So 2112 plus 32 5th equals 2560 plus. I cannot understand because you're not using the word end. You have to see three and two fifths. Okay. If you do kind of like I. Cannot get 2 and 112 plus 3 and 2 fifth equals 2 and 560 plus 3 and 24 over 60, which equals 5 and 29 over 60. Okay. Can I ask you why you made the denominators to 60? Yes. Okay. Why? Michael, why do you think she made this? To make it more easier. Make it more easier. What does that mean? Because without doing that, we can. We can solve this. Yeah, we can solve it without changing this to 16. Yeah. How? 32 5th plus 2112 equals 5 and 3 15, 17. No. Are you sure? Are you sure you're adding the denominators and you're adding the numerator separately? Just add. No, you guys can only add fractions with, like, denominators. Remember that? Okay, not supposed to add these two denominators, right? Yeah, but if you change them to 60 by multiplying 12. Oh, my gosh. Like, I switched the order. Wait, let me do this first. Okay, so how do we change 12 to 60? What do we have to do? Multiply. How do we multiple. What do we have to multiply to make 60? 5. 5. Then we should multiply the numerator, too. Right. Okay. That's why we got 2 and 5 over 60. And what do we have to multiply to make 60? 12. 12. So we have to do times 12 too. Do you get it? Yes. Man, I'm getting tired. Oh, my gosh. We're almost done. So how do we add them? I see Santa claus. Okay, so two plus three is five, right. 516 plus 24 over 60 is 29 over 60. Is that true, Michael? Yes. Okay, can we simplify this? Yeah. No. Why not? Because 20 to 9 is a prime. Actually, we can't. Yeah. Because 29 is a prime number. Well done. So what is the answer 5 and 9. 16. What is the unit? No tons of cons, please. Okay, next two questions. You guys solve it by gonna check the answers. Can you please solve Abby. Hi. Don't share answers, okay? Just tell secretly. Okay. Beast do number two by herself. Guys. Oh, Michael, are you done? Is that the reason why you're heating the camera? No. Michael, are you solving Ms. Jasmine? I got the answer for the second question. Okay, then he tried the third one too. Let's check it. That one. Can you, like, scroll it down a little? Oh, okay. Thanks. You're welcome. For the third one. I don't get it. Okay, then. Michael, did you finish the second one? Wait, I was doing the third one for some reason. Oh, my gosh. This is so tiring. It is not tiring, but it is quite tiring. Oh, my gosh. Okay, let's do the second one together. I got the second answer. Okay. What is that? But Michael, did you even read the second one? You did the third one? I didn't, I didn't know which was second, so I just did the third one and then I, I, I got the, I got it. Like the first equation. Three times four, two, five. And then. Okay, wait, I'm not gonna ask you this now. Let's read the second one first. Okay, so the biggest zucchini from Joe's farm is 2 and 5, 8 pounds, which is 1 in 1 over 12 pounds more than the average weight of zucchinis from his farm. What is the average weight of zucchinis from his farm? So it's 2 5th 8 divided by minus 1, 1 12. Is it divided by or minus 1 divided by. What did my. What did Abby do? I did two fifth eight plus one, one half equals two and six. Okay, everyone's wrong. Oh, my gosh. Look at this. Guys, look. The biggest is 2 and 5, 8 pounds, right? Yeah. And that is 1 and 1 over 12 pounds more than the average. Right. And what is the question? The question's asking you to get the average. Right. So which is more? The. Is the average more or the biggest one more? Which one's heavier? Is this heavier? Is the biggest heavier or the average? You're glitching. Am I? You were glitching. Now, now you're fine. You're fine, you're fine. Go on. So again, I'm going to ask again. Okay, so do you think the average weight is or the weight of the biggest zucchini? Green. Biggest zucchini. Right. How much, how much greater is it? Like how many pounds greater is it? Can you just Find it in the question. How much greater is it? One, one twelve. One twelve. One in one over twelve pounds greater. Right. But are we getting the weight of the bigger zucchini? The biggest zucchini? Is that the question? No. What's the question then? Question is, how much soil was used this month? What is the average weight? Right. Wow, you guys are looking at the third one. I'm going to scroll it down. What? What? The question is, what is the average? Do you get it? You were glitching. Yeah, you were glitching. Am I glitching now too? No. Like, we couldn't hear, like, the sentence you said. We only heard the start of it. Okay, I'm gonna repeat. Okay, so what is the question, guys? What do we have to get the average weight of? The average weight. Right. So we have to get the average weight. What information do we have? What information is it? The big one is 2 and 5, 8 pounds. Right. And we know that this is 1 and 1 over 12 pounds more than the average. So how to put the average? Should we add them or subtract them? Add them. Really? But will it be get. Will it get minus them? Minus them? Right, right. For example, Abby has three cookies. Okay. And that is three less than Jasmine's. Who has more? Is it Abby or Jasmine? Abby, what was my question? Who has more? More? Do you think Abby has more? I'm gonna repeat my question. Abby has three cookies, and that is three less than Jasmine's. Oh, Jasmine, Right. You just heard the word less and you just thought it's minus, right? Yeah, it's actually. So that means 2 fifth. 8 minus 1. 1. Yes. Do you get it? I know why you. You add it first because of the word more. Right. But is that how we do? If we see more, should we add. No. See less. Should we subtract? No, no. You have to understand the situation. Question. Do you get it? Yes. So can you please resolve this question? Oh, Michael's solving. I can see that. What about Abby? I figured that it's one answer. Oh, wait, don't. Don't tell the answer yet. Abby solving. Right. Oh, wait. It's 1 and 52. 1 and 52 over 6. What about you, Michael? 1 and 13 over 24. Okay, let's do this. Let's see who's correct. So what was the equation? My Abby? 2 2, 5 8. 2 and 58 minus 1 and 1 12. Okay, so they. We found out that they don't have, like, denominator. So the common denominator is 96. No. Oh, it's 24. 496 also works because you multiplied 8 and 12. Right, but let's see. Smaller number, the smallest that we can. Right, so what is the least Common multiple of 8 and 12? 24. 24, I guess. So let's change them to 24. So it's 2 and what over 24 is it? Oh my gosh. Abby, can you please sit properly? You're not watching television. 222 and 15 over 24. Well done. Minus. What is it? What is the second one? 1. 1 and 2 over 24. 2 over 24. So can you please tell me the answer? What is it? It's. It's one end and 13 over 24. Perfect. So can we simplify this? Can we simplify? No, no. So no is the answer. What is the unit? If no units then. Wrong. No, wait, wait. Pounds. Wait, no, it's pounds. There's no units. Such as. Yeah, that's what I said. Can I go to the bathroom? You just have five minutes left. Can you hold? What can I. No, it's emergency. Five minutes, Michael. No, it's emergency. Okay, let's do this now. Okay. Can I go? Oh, I'm really getting exhausted. Ms. Jasmine, one last question. Ms. Jasmine, the Santa visit. Visit your house? Not yet. It's Christmas Eve now. Abby, can we do this now? Let's do number two. This will be the last question for you. Okay? Okay. Okay. All of the got eight glasses and four juice. From the picture, the capacity of each glass is 3, 10 liter. If there was enough juice for six glasses. How much juices? 3, 10 times 6. Why? Because it says that there was enough juice for six classes. How many, how much juice was there? Oh my gosh. Michael, can you come. Go back to your seat if you're done. Okay, so Abby actually almost got the answer right. I think you can just solve that. Okay then Michael, can you please read this and tell me what? Can you please read this question? Olivia took out eight glasses and poured juice from the pitcher. The cap was. 3/10. If there was enough juice glasses, how much juice was there? Okay, what will be the equation? 310 times 6. Okay, what about that? 8. What should we do with those 8? I don't know. 8. Why? Why do we have this 8? Is this important in this question that she took out eight glasses? No, no, it's not needed. Right? This information's not needed, right? Don't get tricked. Okay. Okay, so the capacity of each glass is three tenths. And there was enough juice for six glasses. Right. Oh, so we have one glass and that is three tenths liter. And we have six of them. Right? So how much juice was there? Michael, can you tell me the equation? I need to use the bathroom. Just tell me the answer first. What is the answer? 18 over 60. 3/10 times 6, which is 1810. Oh, 1810. Anyone? Can. Anyone? Okay. Abigail. Michael. Do you know how to write this in decimals? No. Are you sure? Actually, yes. What is it? 1.8, 0.82? 1. No. 0.18. This is 1800s. Is this 1800s? No. This is 1 and 8, 10, which is 1 and 8/10. Do you get it? This is 1, 8, 10 liter. Yeah. Okay. I can. I think it's done. Okay. Wait, did Abby fall down? Okay, let's. Okay, when Abby comes back, I'm gonna say bye to her. Okay. And to you. Okay. Are you waiting for Santa Claus? My name is Solon.",
